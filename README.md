    - Create an Account
    - Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account.
    - Create a New Cluster
    - Choose a Cloud Provider and Region
    - Configure Cluster Settings
    - Create Cluster
    - Wait for Cluster to Deploy
    - Create Database User
    - Set Up IP Whitelist
    - Connect to Cluster
    - Configure Your Application
    - Test the Connection

2. Create a new database and configure the `.env` file with the MongoDB connection URL. 

## Steps to run server
